**EMail-Client trying to replicate the Hey.com behavior on IMAP service over something like OX (openXchange - used by a lot of email providers)**

# Approach 

Decouple from the typical email folder style view to special views for each UX case and hide all the email filter stuff under a opinonated UX approach.
Using the points mentioned here https://firesofmay.substack.com/p/hey-app-review-a-personal-take

* Screener
  * Move all emails to a imap folder with a filter
  * if screened out - make a blacklist for this email -> gone
  * if screened in - do a filter to move all future mails to one of the three categories, move all existing mails from the screener accordingly
  * The user will propably handle all screener mails but if not nothing decided delete after certain amount of days
* 3 Kind of emails. Important, Feed, Paper Trail
* Important category
  * Unread at first
  * Then two approaches possible
    * Read means nothing is done, leave it in the inbox - it is the read later stack. 
    * If you done - archive it. Move it out of the Inbox folder
    * Or
    * Read means nothing is done, all mails in the inbox.
    * Somehow marked (Star?) if it's the read later stack
  * Set aside - some imap tag on it that it can be presented 
  
* Feed and Paper Trail 
  * have no unread/read status and moved with filters to imap folders
  * If you move a address to these categories - add filters and move all emails from the inbox to the corresponding folders
  
* Contact Page
  * Show a contact page, with all mails, categorisation, attachments and so on
  * If you change category move and adapt filters
  * Show extracted email signature

* Helpful stuff
  * Rename email threads -> possible with IMAP
  * Not sure if merging is possible -> TODO
  * Notification are Opt-in for all except the Important category
  * Replace a to big attachment with a link and upload it to some service - Call a script standard https://transfer.sh/ but so can be customized
  * Check if it's is possible to replicate a note feature. Usecase. Email thread -> Phone Conversation -> Add notes to the corresponding topic
  * Get rid of those annoying email signatures in threads - https://github.com/mailgun/talon

* Technology
  * Just using evolution data server - gives all imap stuff.
  * Additional must be the **filter rules of the mail provider be changeable per API**. Possible with OX and will be target. Do it as plugin, so other can add their provider if they want. Or call bash script or js stuff or something to help with authentification stuff and make it more accessible
  * If it's feasible to use a Trackingpixel blocker do it. Maybe something like https://github.com/stefanXO/PixelBlock - Investigate
